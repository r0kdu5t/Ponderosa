Customize your build~
The base for your self compiled version has to be Tasmota. Do NOT use a other Tasmota build variant for.

Create a new file in /tasmota folder called user_config_override.h. You can copy the sample file user_config_override_sample.h that is already there and which include some sample definition for coding your own Wifi SSID and pasword inside the Tasmota firmware.

Open the file in chosen development environment for editing.

Enter lines required to enable or disable desired feature. All features and their identifier can be found in my_user_config.h.
