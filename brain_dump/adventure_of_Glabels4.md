# Decided to waste some more time whilst the sun was out compiling an update of Glabels 4.

Step 1.
  Did the 'git pull' and 'git fetch' thing. Aparently all was upto date.
  
Step 2.
  Found the 'BUILD.Linux' instructions and followed along.
  Diverted to do a 'git clone' of zint.
  Had a cmake error which needed https://github.com/jimevins/glabels-qt/pull/164/files
